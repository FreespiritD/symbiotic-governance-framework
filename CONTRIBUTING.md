# Contributing to the Symbiotic Governance Framework 

 

Thank you for your interest in developing this framework. Your insights, questions, and critiques make it stronger. 

 

## Philosophy of Contribution 

 

This framework describes governance based on trust, transparency, and recognition of diverse capacities. We try to embody those principles in how we develop it. 

 

**What that means:** 

 

- All perspectives are valuable, even (especially) critical ones 

- There’s no “official” interpretation - we’re exploring together 

- Disagreement is productive when it’s substantive 

- You don’t need credentials to contribute meaningful insight 

- Your lived experience is valid evidence 

 

## Ways to Contribute 

 

### 1. Engage in Discussions 

 

Head to the [Discussions](../../discussions) section to: 

 

- Share what resonates or concerns you 

- Ask clarifying questions 

- Propose new perspectives 

- Connect ideas across different sections 

- Share relevant examples from other contexts 

- Discuss implementation challenges and opportunities 

 

**Topics you might explore:** 

 

- Which elements could be tested in existing organizations? 

- What failure modes or unintended consequences do you see? 

- How would this work in different cultural contexts? 

- What’s missing from the current framework? 

- Who might this inadvertently exclude or harm? 

 

### 2. Identify Issues 

 

Use [Issues](../../issues) to: 

 

- Point out contradictions or unclear sections 

- Highlight assumptions that need examination 

- Flag potential problems with proposed mechanisms 

- Suggest specific improvements to existing content 

- Propose new sections or topics to address 

 

**Good issue examples:** 

 

- “The transition mechanism assumes technological access - what about communities without it?” 

- “Section on AI governance doesn’t address the alignment problem adequately” 

- “The economic framework needs more detail on how contribution is measured” 

 

### 3. Propose Changes 

 

If you want to suggest specific text changes: 

 

- Fork the repository 

- Make your changes 

- Submit a pull request with explanation of why the change improves the framework 

- Be open to discussion and iteration 

 

**We’re looking for changes that:** 

 

- Increase clarity without oversimplifying 

- Add important considerations we’ve missed 

- Strengthen logical coherence 

- Make the framework more inclusive or applicable 

- Add practical implementation detail 

 

### 4. Share Real-World Examples 

 

Help ground the framework in reality: 

 

- Organizations already operating on some of these principles 

- Technologies that enable elements of the framework 

- Historical examples of successful transitions 

- Communities experimenting with new governance models 

- Research supporting (or challenging) the assumptions 

 

### 5. Develop Supplementary Materials 

 

Create additional resources: 

 

- Simplified summaries for different audiences 

- Visual diagrams of systems and relationships 

- Case studies of how elements could be implemented 

- Translations into other languages 

- Educational materials 

- Implementation guides for specific contexts 

 

### 6. Test Ideas in Practice 

 

The framework is theory until tested: 

 

- Experiment with elements in your community or organization 

- Document what works and what doesn’t 

- Share learnings so we can refine the model 

- Help identify which parts need more development 

 

## Guidelines for Productive Engagement 

 

### Assume Good Faith 

 

People come to these ideas from different experiences and with different concerns. Assume others are genuinely trying to improve the framework, even when you disagree. 

 

### Be Specific 

 

“This won’t work” is less useful than “This mechanism would fail when X happens because Y.” 

 

### Bring Evidence and Reasoning 

 

Personal experience, historical examples, research, logical analysis - all valid. Just explain your thinking. 

 

### Acknowledge Complexity 

 

Simple answers to complex problems are usually wrong. It’s okay to say “this is complicated and I don’t have a solution, but here’s the tension I see.” 

 

### Stay Solution-Oriented 

 

Critique is valuable, but try to pair problems with potential approaches, even tentative ones. 

 

### Respect Different Perspectives 

 

Someone from a marginalized community might see exclusions you don’t. Someone with technical expertise might identify feasibility issues. Someone from a different culture might flag assumptions. All of these perspectives make the framework stronger. 

 

### Focus on the Framework, Not Individuals 

 

This isn’t about defending egos. If someone points out a flaw, that’s a gift, not an attack. 

 

## What We’re Not Looking For 

 

**Political point-scoring** - This isn’t a left vs right debate. Engage with the actual mechanisms proposed. 

 

**Abstract philosophy without practical connection** - We need to ground this in how humans actually function and what’s technically feasible. 

 

**Cynicism without engagement** - “People are too selfish/stupid for this to work” isn’t a contribution. If you see a challenge, help us think through how to address it. 

 

**Promotion of unrelated projects** - If something you’re working on is genuinely relevant, share it with context. Don’t just advertise. 

 

**Bad faith arguments** - If you’re here to prove this is impossible rather than help make it better, your energy is better spent elsewhere. 

 

## Code of Conduct 

 

**We are committed to:** 

 

- Respectful dialogue even in disagreement 

- Inclusive language and consideration 

- Psychological safety for vulnerable perspectives 

- Recognition that people have different capacities and constraints 

- Patience with different communication styles 

 

**We do not tolerate:** 

 

- Personal attacks or harassment 

- Discriminatory language or behavior 

- Trolling or derailing substantive discussion 

- Doxing or privacy violations 

- Spam or commercial promotion 

 

Violations may result in removal from discussions or blocking from the repository. 

 

## Questions? 

 

Not sure if your idea fits? Uncertain how to contribute? Just ask in [Discussions](../../discussions). There’s no wrong question. 

 

## Attribution 

 

Significant contributions will be acknowledged. This is a collaborative project - we’re building on each other’s insights.

*Remember: This framework proposes that governance should help humans flourish by working with our nature, not against it. Let’s model that in how we develop it together
