# Discussion Questions 

 

These are open questions to stimulate thinking and identify areas needing development: 

 

1. How do we recognize when AI crosses the threshold into sentience requiring representation? 

 

2. What mechanisms prevent concentration of power in those who control technology infrastructure? 

 

3. How do bioregions with vastly different resource endowments achieve equity? 

 

4. Can human psychology adapt quickly enough to this level of transparency and participation? 

 

5. What happens when human and AI delegates disagree on existential risk assessment? 

 

6. How does this framework address communities without technological access during transition? 

 

7. What are the failure modes we haven't considered? 

 

8. How would this work in cultures with very different values around individualism vs collectivism? 

 

9. What existing systems or communities already embody elements of this framework? 

 

10. What would a pilot project look like to test core concepts?
